    home_html: '<p>Altwustrow is a village in Brandeburg. VERANTWORTUNG 3000 wants to create a gathering in Altwustrow, for 6 days in September 2016. VERANTWORTUNG 3000 is a space for exchange and critical discussion on contemporary music.</p><p>VERANTWORTUNG 3000 will be initiated by BLATT 3000. BLATT 3000 does not want any curation. BLATT 3000 wants a system of self-curation. All participants are responsible for the programming and realisation.</p><p>VERANTWORTUNG 3000 offers facilities, food and a platform for managing resources. Participants offer their resources and make use of others’ resources to create a programme. Everyone brings his or her loot, so we can share, play and eat together in Altwustrow.</p><p>VERANTWORTUNG 3000 is self-financed. Participation cost is approx. 90 Euros. Further information on the programme on VERANTWORTUNG3000.de.</p>'

    about_title: 'About'
    about_html: '<p>VERANTWORTUNG 3000 is an event taking place in Altwustrow (Brandenburg) from 30 August to 4 September 2016. VERANTWORTUNG 3000 is initiated by BLATT 3000. BLATT 3000 is neither the curator nor artistic director. Participants themselves will curate and programme by creating events on this platform. VERANTWORTUNG 3000 is a tool for self-curation. All BLATT 3000 does, is to take care of the spaces, that we will all make use of.</p><p>During these 6 days, we will have a large farm for ourselves (5000m2). The farm belongs to our lovely host Peter, who will be so kind to leave us his space for the whole time. On the farm there is a house, in which most of us will find space to sleep, some others will have to live in tents in the garden. Overall, there is space for 50 people. You can get a feel for the different localities, if you go to PLACES. We will all have to provide food for ourselves - BLATT 3000 will do the shopping, everyone will cook for all of us.</p><h3>PLATFORM</h3><p>VERANTWORTUNG3000.de is everyone’s tool of organisation and basis of communication. Every participiant registers and will be displayed via a profil. When registered you can create productions and events, enter your instruments and all other equipment, that you need or bring along.</p><p>An instrument is to be understood in an abstract way - it is an activity or object which a performer makes use of (i.e. voice or tambourin or shoes). Equipment (i.e. microphone) is not necessarily tied to a performer and might be used by other participants.</p><p>All different categories will be connected to each other on the platform, so that everyone always sees, when what how and where something happens and who is involved. All that will be found on the ‚CALENDAR‘. So VERANTWORTUNG3000.de is the platform on which you connect with one another, plan productions, collaborations, search for performers, instruments, equipment or offer your cooking services. There is also a BLACKBOARD, which can be used for any request to the community.</p><p>Email is the main way of communication and will be useful for further dialogues and arranging details, collaborating etc.</p><p>The platform is the office headquarter: this is where the main festival organisation takes place and is at the same time used to share tasks and resposibilities. All participants are responsible for realising VERANTWORTUNG 3000. BLATT 3000 solemnly coordinates the structure and communication of the platform.</p>'
