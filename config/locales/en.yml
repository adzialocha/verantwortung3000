      <p>An event takes places within a fixed timeframe, at a particular venue and is part of a production. That means, there might be more than one event for one production (i.e. rehearsals). You can assign which instruments, equipment and what venue you want to use for your event, therefore making sure you reserve that specific space for a certain time.</p>

        <p>An instrument can be anything that is part of a performance and tied to a performer, who plays that instrument - but can be anything from voice to shoes, movement to viola. Here you can choose from all the instruments in the database, that you need for this event (unless they are in use at that time already).</p>
        <p>This instrument and the associated performer will be registered as part of your event. The person involved will automatically receive an email and be informed about the collaboration.</p>
        <p>Obviously the performer has to approve of the collaboration, so it might be best to first contact her or him via email (see profile)</p>
        <p>All further agreements and details on the collaboration and event will also be dealt with via email.</p>
        <h3>Is the instrument you are looking for not available?</h3>
        <p>If your favourite instrument is not available, choose option „Not available“ and name and describe what you are looking for here. A request will automatically be created on the blackboard. Participants who are interested in collaborating will then reach you via email and hopefully register that instrument in the database, so you can then add it to your event.</p>
      
      help_edit_devices: "Edit equipment"
      help_edit_devices_html: |-
        <p>Equipment is not tied to a person - so can be anything from beamer to speaker to microphone. Here you can choose from all the equipment in the database, that you need for this event (unless it is in use at that time already).</p>
        <p>The equipment will be registered as part of your event. The owner will automatically receive an email and be informed about the request.</p>
        <p>Obviously the owner has to approve of the use of the equipment, so it might be best to first contact her or him via email (see profile)</p>
        <p>All further agreements and details of the event (meeting, handing over, technical details etc.) will also be dealt with via email.</p>
        <h3>Is the equipment you are looking for not available?</h3>
        <p>If the equipment you are looking for is not available, choose option „Not available“ and name and describe what you are looking for here. A request will automatically be created on the blackboard. Participants who might help you out will then reach you via email and hopefully register that equipment in the database, so you can then add it to your event.</p>
